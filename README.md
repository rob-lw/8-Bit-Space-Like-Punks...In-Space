# Challenge Description 
> We're interested in POAPs that can engage our community! We want to see you create a piece of artwork that captures what it means to invest in the future - 8 bit style. We've seen punks, galactic apes, and other projects apply an 8 bit style to great effect and we want to see what you can come up with!
